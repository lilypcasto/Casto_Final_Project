# Casto_Final_Project

This is the repo for the Final Project for Data Wrangling.

## **Dataset Summary:** 

#### The repository includes code for the documentation of Canadian active wildfires in 2025.

**File Structure:**
- `data_raw/` – raw datasets
- `code/` – R code and documents
- `outputs/` – cleaned and finalized data, figures, tables, and reports
- `README.md` – overview of the project

**Data Set Contents:** The data set contains information on the
following:

1.  `agency type responding to the fire`
2.   `fire-name classification`
3.  `latitude and longitude of the fire`
4.  `hectares burned`
5.  `exact start date`
6.  `stage of control`
7.  `response type`

**Final Project Info:**
This Canadian wildfires project integrates concepts and skills from multiple weeks of the course. This includes Week 7 which focuses on Problem Decomposition, including introducing the dataset, outlining the overall tasks, and providing descriptions of the code chunks (lines 8–48). Week 8 covers project organization by creating an RStudio Project with structured subdirectories and the use of relative file paths. Week 10 is represented through the creation of a GitHub repository, including a README file that documents and describes the project. Week 5 is incorporated in lines 36–137, where two visualizations—a map and a plot—were created to highlight key information about the wildfires and are saved in the outputs folder. Week 14 applies the lubridate package to create a new column from an existing date variable, generating ordered month levels (line 127). Week 6 demonstrates Tidy Data principles through renaming and organizing columns (lines 71–75). Week 11 integrates the use of an if-else function to analyze peak fire dangers (lines 141-149).
